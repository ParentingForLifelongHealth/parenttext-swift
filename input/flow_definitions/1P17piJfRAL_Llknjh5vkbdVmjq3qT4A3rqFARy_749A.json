For example, say, “Either you do your homework now, or you cannot watch your favourite T.V. show tonight.”\n\n✅ Talk about consequences for breaking household rules when you set them so Your Teen knows them already.\n\n✅ Notice if your teen is experiencing a consequence to their action already.\n",
